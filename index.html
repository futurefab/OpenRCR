      <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"></a>What is GitHub?</h3>
We have a guide explaining this here. But briefly, projects like OpenRCR can get very complicated. There are scores of parts, files and documents that are all regularly updated.

To keep control of these versions is a lot of work. GitHub is a well established web service that manages all this very easily.

All you need to do is worry about downloading the <a href="https://github.com/futurefab/OpenRCR/zipball/master">latest compressed .ZIP file</a> and working through the <a href="http://futurefab.org.uk/category/tutorials/">tutorials</a> to make your home made R/C Car.
<h3>This is all free?</h3>
It sure is! All the files you need will be free and always will be but if you want to <a href="http://futurefab.org.uk/products-page/">order a kit</a> then there will be a small charge to cover manufacturing costs.

If you want to register a team for competition, there is a small admin charge to cover event costs but other than that,
<h3>I'd like to donate.</h3>
Excellent! FutureFab is a small organisation and the OpenRCR competition needs funds to run web servers, cover insurance and venue costs, so if you would like to support us, then you are most welcome and donations of any size will be greatly received!

<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"></a>What do I need to make my OpenRCR Car?</h3>
The short answer is some hand tools, a soldering iron, access to a 3D Printer and some hobbyist radio gear. The long answer is documented in the blog and tutorials. Check out our get started guide to get the low down on your next steps.

If you want to <a href="http://futurefab.org.uk/products-page/">purchase a kit</a>, to speed things up a bit you can by visiting our <a href="http://futurefab.org.uk/products-page/">shop</a>.
<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually"></a>What is OpenSource all about?</h3>
We have a full guide on this which can be found here. In short, it's a distribution model where not only is the end product freely available but also the files used to make that product. This concept started with software where developers would share their code for others to edit. The OpenRCR project uses the well established OpenHardware principle. All of the car's files are free to download, edit and redistribute as you seen fit.
